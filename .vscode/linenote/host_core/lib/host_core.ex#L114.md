## Observations:

1. This function is really long, hence, affecting its readability

## Opportunities for rectaring:

1. Break this function into smaller functions. A good rule to follow would be to ensure that each of your functions adhere to the rule of `one level of abstraction` as described in the book `Clean Code`

   A good example would be to move the `case` in line 119, to a function on it's own.
