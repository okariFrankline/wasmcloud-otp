## Opportunity for refactoring

1. Ensure that you group all the `aliases` together as well as the `requires`

2. Ensure that the module attributes are also defined after the last require statements

3. Follow the stylistic guidelines defined [here](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide#modules)

### Recommendations

1. Use `Credo` to ensure the stylistic guidelines are followed.
